# Hangman Game  
This repository contains a simple text-based Hangman game written in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player attempts to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## Features

- Random word selection from a list.
- Text-based user interface.
- Visual feedback for the number of lives remaining.

## How to Run the Game

To run this game, you will need Python installed on your computer. It also depends on the `replit` module for clearing the console, which can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install replit

Steps to Run the Game:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the cloned directory.

Run the game using Python:
python hangman_game.py
Enjoy playing Hangman and try to guess the word before you run out of lives!

- You might want to remove the testing line displaying the solution when you deploy or share this game for actual gameplay to provide a real challenge.
- Ensure that your rep
